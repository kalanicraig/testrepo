Paul Garza (He/Him) recently graduated with a B.A. in both History and Sociology. Paul participated in the Ronald E. McNair program in undergrad and continues with a McNair Fellowship at Indiana University. Paul’s research focuses on United States Latine populations while delving into themes related to higher education, race, class, and gender. Paul’s latest research project explores the representation of Latine faculty members across Texas Universities via oral histories.

Paul’s research goals include decolonizing the American narrative and academia by continuing to tell strategically untold stories of marginalized people. His research will include public history practices that prioritize shared authority with the community.
